Please try the following:

1. Note that only MySQL is supported right now.

2. Make sure 'res/conf.d' and your DB are set up correctly. (Recompile
   this program if you've changed 'res/conf.d'). See 'res/conf-sample.d'
   for details.

3. Make sure your DB user has the following permissions:
   SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

   Additionally, permissions for CREATE and DROP are needed for initial
   setup of the DB (then they can be revoked if you wish).

4. Your DB user must use MySQL's new-style long password hash, not the
   very-old-style short password hash. (Just reset the DB user's password
   to be sure. It will use the new-style automatically.)

5. Run this program with the --init-db switch to create the needed DB tables
   (THIS WILL DESTROY ALL DATA!)
